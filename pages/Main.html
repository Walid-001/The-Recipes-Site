    <h4>Flank Steak with Caramelized Onions and Balsamic Glaze</h4>

    <p>The reduced balsamic vinegar sauce gives the flank steak a unique flavor that pairs perfectly with the caramelized onions.  Both the steak and onions contribute a hefty dose of potassium to this entrée--766 milligrams in each serving. Serve with steamed broccoli or asparagus, and drizzle some of the glaze over the vegetable.</p>

    <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Time: 45mins (25mins cooking time)</li>
        <li>Serving size: 4 Servings
            <ul>
                <li>serving size: about 3 ounces steak, about 1/4 cup onions, and about 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cups vertically sliced onion (about 1 1/2 pounds) </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 (1-pound) flank steak, trimmed</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

        <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small, heavy saucepan. Reduce heat to medium; cook until reduced to 1/4 cup (about 5 minutes). Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, and sauté 10 minutes or until tender. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt; sauté 18 minutes or until onions are golden brown. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steak with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, and thyme. Place steak on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray; broil 6 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Cutsteak diagonally across grain into thin slices. Serve steak over onions; drizzle with balsamic glaze.</li>
            <li>Steak and caramelized onions are fabulous partners for numerous red wines. But the balsamic vinegar glaze presents a bit of a challenge since vinegar can make wine taste sharp. One variety stands up especially well to vinegar: syrah (also known as shiraz). There are many great syrah/shirazes available. </li>
